                                     (चौरासी कुटिया), is an ashram close to the north Indian city
                                      of Rishikesh in the state of Uttarakhand. It is located
                                       on the eastern bank of the Ganges river, opposite the Muni

                                                productive period as songwriters, where they composed

                                                 also known as the "White Album".
