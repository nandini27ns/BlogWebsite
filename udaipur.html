                                       his favourite horse Chetak, stands atop the Moti Magri

                   Udaipur was my last stop as part of a 10-day trip of Rajasthan that took me 
                   through sandy Bikaner and Jaisalmer, arid and rocky Jodhpur, and mountainous
                   Kumbhalgarh. And when I arrived in the cool, green lake city of Udaipur,
                   I was in for a bit of a shock. A pleasant shock, I must hasten to clarify.
                   Part of the shock was how different it was from the image that comes to
                    mind when one imagines Rajasthan, and part of the reason was how much
                     Udaipur looked like the pictures I had seen of the city. ðŸ™‚
                     I spent a couple of days exploring Udaipur, wandering in the alleyways
                      of its old city, touring the famous City Palace on the banks of the Lake
                       Pichola, visiting memorials and gardens, stuffing myself with sweets,
                        picking souvenirs and bandhini dupattas, going on boat ridesâ€¦ Presenting 
                        some images from my wanderings in UdaipurðŸ™‚
