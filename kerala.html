                    I have been to Kerala thrice and all my trips to the God’s own country are worth mentioning.
                    Ever since my first ever Malayali friend showed me the snaps of picturesque Munnar , i couldn’t resist the
                     relentless desire to visit the place.Hill station of Southern India was something totally unheard of.
                      Call it my ignorance but i just couldn’t wrap my head around the fact that there could be fog ,
                       mountains and most shocking - cold in South.<br>
                       TRANSPORT:Auto drivers are quite honest and friendly , they charge you by the rate & speak decent English. This is one of the important aspect of travelling coz last thing you wana do on your trip is to bargain<br>
                       PEOPLE:Not to impress the Malayali readers but i genuinely found an average Keralite very warm and amiable to interact with, irrespective of age and gender. I still do.
                        Unlike the general perception & the instruction given by my friend about the strict no usage of Hindi among the local , i was quite surprised when my queries were answered in Hindi after i inquired them in English.
