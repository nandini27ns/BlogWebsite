                   <h3>LAND OF LAMAS</h3><br>
              
               <p>Located in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, 
                Leh is known for its stunning scenic locales, Buddhist
                 temples and pristine environment. Due to the strong 
                 influence of Tibetan Buddhism, Leh is also known as
                  Little Tibet or the Land of Lamas. Barren mountain
                  s with brightly painted gompas (or monasteries),
                   fluttering prayer flags, rocky ridges, tiny settlements
                    and the Indus River add to the overall charm of the region.

                                     one of the highest altitude lakes in the 
                                     world and is famed for its colour changing
                                      water, from blue to red and green. From
                                       camping to lakeside bonfire, a wide variety 
                                       of activities can be enjoyed here. During the

                                         frozen, which is a delightful sight in itself.
