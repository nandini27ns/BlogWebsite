                    If you are reading this review, then you probably already know something about
                     Ladakh, or have at least seen photos. It's one of the most breathtaking places
                      on earth. But there are a couple noteworthy things that i hadn't known about 
                      before, but learned on this trip. Ladakh is one of the cleanest places in India! 
                      No offense to Indians from other areas, but Ladakh takes the gold medal for cleanliness!
                       Because Ladakh is so remote, there is a sense of not wasting anything or discarding 
                       anything haphazardly. Ladakhis are naturally conservation-minded people. Everything
                        gets re-used, and therefore there is very little garbage and litter on the streets.
                         By the same token, Ladakhis are very ecologically aware. Water is a precious commodity
                          in the high altitude desert, and rivers and water sources are well cared for. In other 
                          parts of India, rivers and streams become a dumping ground for waste, but in Ladakh
                           it is quite the opposite. I was very impressed that Leh has a water bottle filling
                            station geared toward tourists that allows you to fill your bottle with boiled UV 
                            treated water for only 7 Rps. This is half the price of a bottle of mineral water,
                             and it doesn't lead to another empty plastic bottle being discarded on the streets.
